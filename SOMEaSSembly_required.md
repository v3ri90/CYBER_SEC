IN THIS WEB EXPLOITATION CHALLENGE I WAS GIVEN THIS LINK TO A WEBSITE WITH NO HINTS ON HOW TO SOLVE IT. 

http://mercury.picoctf.net:1896/index.html

I therefore proceeded to visit the link's site and viewed its code.

Inside it there was a javascript link and I clicked on it.

It took me to a page where I was able to obtain a file path '/JISxzHyW8W'.

I took this link and added it to the original URL and this led me to a file that contained this flag at the bottom
